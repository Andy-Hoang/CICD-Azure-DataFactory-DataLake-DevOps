# CICD Hotfix in Production

## Problem: real-life handling a hotfix in PROD Scenario   

1. A feature branch **`feat2`** was developed, approved via PR, and merged into `main`. It is waiting for review and approval before deployment to `PROD`.  
2. An urgent hotfix **(`fixfeat1`)** is needed in `PROD`, but **`feat2`** should not be included in this deployment.  
   - If we follow the typical flow, **`feat2`** would be deployed along with hotfix **`fixfeat1`**, which is not desirable.  
3. We still want to keep **`feat2`** in `main` for later review and deployment.  

## Solution:

![HotFixFlow-GitDiagram](/assets/3.HotFixFlow-GitDiagram.png)

1. **Create a hotfix branch** from the current `PROD` version.  
   - This branch reflects the exact state of `PROD`, **excluding `feat2`**.  

2. **Manually trigger the pipeline** from this hotfix branch to deploy **only `fixfeat1`** to `PROD`.  

3. **Merge the hotfix branch into `main`**.  
   - This ensures that `main` now contains both **`fixfeat1`** (the hotfix) and **`feat2`** (the pending feature), keeping it up to date for future deployments.  

4. **Cancel the previous pipeline run that included only `feat2`**.  
   - This prevents deploying an outdated version that **excludes** the hotfix.

This approach ensures that urgent fixes are deployed independently while keeping ongoing feature work in sync with `main`.


## Demo:

### Add feature branch and pending to Prod

add a branch 'feat2', and add a new pipeline

![ADF-AddBranchFeat2](/assets/3.ADF-AddBranchFeat2.png)

Create PR and merge to main branch

![Devops-MergeFeat2ToMain](/assets//3.Devops-MergeFeat2ToMain.png

Waiting to be approved to PROD; DEV already got pipeline2, but not in PROD

Pending to Prod

### Create a HotFix branch

Use Azure Devops ENVIRONMENT >>> Get the last commit ID **on PROD**

![LastCommitOnProd](/assets/3.LastCommitOnProd.png)

![LastCommitOnProd2](/assets/3.LastCommitOnProd2.png)

Create a HotFix branch 'fixfeat1' based on this commit ID

![CreateHotFixBranch](/assets/3.CreateHotFixBranch.png)

Apply the fix

![ApplyHotFix](/assets/3.ApplyHotFix.png)

In Azure Devops, dont create a PULL REQUEST, but run the pipeline manually: Pipelines >> Run pipeline>>> select the Hotfix branch to run >> approve to Prod

![RunPipelineManuallyFromHotFixBranch](/assets/3.RunPipelineManuallyFromHotFixBranch.png)

Check the Result on Prod

![HotFixResultProd](/assets/3.HotFixResultProd.png)


### Merge the hotfix branch into `main`

Create PR to merge

![MergeHotFixBranch](/assets/3.MergeHotFixBranch.png)

Check result: DEV includes both he hotfix, and the feat2 branch, while the PROD only includes hotfix

![ADF-ResultAfterMergeHotFix](/assets/3.ADF-ResultAfterMergeHotFix.png)

### Cancel the previous pipeline run that included only `feat2`

Because this `feat2` request does not include hotfix. So need to decline to be safe. Otherwise someone approve this, deployed to PROD, the hotfix will be overwritten

Locate the Pipeline Run for feat2 only

![PipelineRun-Feat2Only](/assets/3.PipelineRun-Feat2Only.png)

Reject the Pipeline Run

The end result
